            What is school in general?
        </h2>
         <p>
            School is a place where students go to learn and acquire knowledge. It is a formal institution that offers education and training to students from kindergarten to college. Schools provide students with an environment that encourages learning and personal growth. In addition to academics, schools also offer extracurricular activities such as sports, music, and clubs, which provide students with opportunities to explore their interests and develop their skills. Overall, schools play a vital role in shaping the future of students and society as a whole.
